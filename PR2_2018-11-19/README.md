# problem-description

The setup for the problem was found here https://github.com/FITCommunity/Programiranje-2/blob/master/Ispiti/2018-11-19/PR2_2018-11-19_Postavka.cpp

This was just my attempt at solving it as a way to practice for upcoming exams and such
I am not sure this is a good solution due to not having a chance to properly ask all questions
to clear up some stuff or just a skill issue on my end

I recommend looking at the most recent exam I've done since I'll probably develop a better feel
of how to do things by then
