# problem-description

Many thanks to the individuals who helped me collect all the information, wouldn't have been able to do it alone

The problem for this exam was similar to https://github.com/FITCommunity/Programiranje-2/blob/master/Ispiti/2022-06-30/PR2_2022-06-30_Postavka.cpp

Slight difference were:

_trenutno was type int
Kolekcija only had AddElement, Insert (not InsertAt and there was something with operator())
_ocjenaKriterija was actually _komentarKriterija with the type Kolekcija<Kriteriji, const char*>*
Class Osoba (probably as the base for class Gost?)
There was also something with collecting point to gain VIP status and displaying it inside the info method

Keep in mind these things were collected through talk with students who took the exams that day so some stuff might be inaccurate
