# problem-description

The setup for the problem was made from various people and images I found after the exam was taken

This wasn't really an attempt to "Solve it" due to how similar it was to the previous one, I just
copied it and changed the things that needed to be changed

As usual tho, the most recent solution is probably the most reliable
